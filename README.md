# IOFlat | Iosevka Flat

Iosevka Flat is a customized variation of the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) typeface, drawing inspiration from the clean, monospaced style of [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/). This project blends the sharp, minimalist design of Iosevka with the readability and aesthetics of Hack, creating a font ideal for coding (at least for me).

## Features
- **Flat Aesthetic**: Adjustments inspired by Hack for a familiar and professional look.
- **Monospaced Design**: Ensures alignment in code editors and terminal applications.
- **Lightweight and Readable**: Balanced characters for long coding sessions.
